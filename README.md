# Fruit-Clustering-using-K-Means-Algorithm
In this project, we utilized the K-Means clustering algorithm to group fruits based on a given dataset. The dataset contains attributes such as fruit_label, fruit_name,
fruit_subtype, mass, width, height, and color_score. By applying the K-Means algorithm, we were able to identify natural clusters within the dataset and assign fruits to their 
respective clusters.
